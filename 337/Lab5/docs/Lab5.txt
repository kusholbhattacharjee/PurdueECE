1. Minimum amount of time data_ready must be asserted to ensure correct operation is 2 clock cycles, 18 ns since one clck cycle is 9 ns.

Minimum amount of time data must be valid is 7 clock cycles because that is how long it takes to load the data. that is 63 ns.


2. the filtered images are darker than the original, but each filtered image is very different in how bright the colored lines are. This makes sense I guess since we put in different coefficients and filtered each one differently so each filtered image looks very different from each other. 


3. FILE OPERATIONS

fopen('filename','r') opens a rile and reads it in binary
fclose() closes the file
fwrite() writes to the file
fscanf() reads each character from the file however you specify
ftell() tells the file what to write into the file (not sure about this one)
fseek() moves around the cursor in the file

4. FORMAT FOR FSCANF
%b binary
%c character
%d int
%f float
%s string
